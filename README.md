The `manuals` folder contains the manuals for language proposals created
during the DoD languages competition which led to Ada.

See `history.pdf` to understand what this repo relates to.

In the future I am thinking of trying to implement one or more of these
languages.

Put BSL as license if I add code here, but language documents in manuals
folder were published online by the US government and BSL license has
nothing to do with them.

`history.pdf` and the Phase I manuals/reference documents were sourced
from a larger PDF which contains the Phase I references + different
groups' judgements on those proposals + more.

That larger PDF was retrieved from this
[US gov. link](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/trecms/pdf/ADB950587.pdf).

The Phase II version of Red \(since Intermetrics/Red moved on to
Phase II with Green\) was retrieved from this
[US gov. link](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA219453.pdf).

As of the writing of this README, Mary Van Deusen, who worked on the
Red proposal, also has a high-quality web version of the Phase II Red
reference manual along with additional information about the competition
available
[here](https://www.iment.com/maida/computer/redref/index.htm)
on her website.

For Phase II Green I was able to find DTIC links for an
["informal introduction"](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA070753.pdf)
and a
[formal definition](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA073714.pdf).

I am going off of the April 1979 dating of those documents to determine that
they relate to the Phase II version.

The formal definition should be sufficient to implement that version of the
language.
